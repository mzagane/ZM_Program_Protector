# ZM_Program_Protector
Often, the viruses infect the programs file i.e. which have  extensions (exe, COM, DLL, ocx...). And others virus (macros  virus) infect the HTML file,  images... to protect your  files and  especially when you are obliged to connect your USB key to  infected computer, or if you want to share a directory in a  network, there is  an idea consists to rename your files by  adding a string to the extensions  has fine to change their types  (*.exe --> exedd,  html --> htmlff) and after you removes the  added  chains and thus restores their types.  But that becomes  tiresome if there are many files to rename and especially if you  classified them in sub-directory.  To automate the operation  (rename / restore), I programmed ZM Programs Protector.  With  ZM Programs Protector it is enough to indicate the basic  directory where your files exist and the files types to be  protected and it do the remainder.
